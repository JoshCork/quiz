# General Notes
A detailed account of my experience in reverse chronological order.

## Day 5:  11/21

- cleaned up and got it working again.  
- now I need to use select statements and have the timer call the results function or break out.  
  - He covers this in his video: https://gophercises.com/exercises/quiz


## Day 4: 11/17
- implemented flags for choosing new quiz file
- started implementing the timer functionality but I still have more work to do there.
  - I need to break out the scoring feature and call that if the timer runs out and then exit the program.
  - If they complete the quiz I need to call the scoring feature and stop the timeer. 

## Day 3: 11/16/2017

- I can now read in a file and print the values of that file to standard out and await a response for stanard in.
- My code is now comparing the input from standard in to the expected answer.
- My code accurately counts the number of correct answers and informs the user how many answer they got correct out of the total number of questions.


## Day 1: 11/03/2017

- Leaving off here:

  - I started writing the solution based on GoByExample work and stumbling through things.  I am now able to read a file line by line. 

  - Need to pick up here on Monday and understand what the scan split function is doing specifically and then write the output of iterating through that into a map?  Into an array?  into a name value pair? I should probably document strategy first thing on Monday.

- Confusion: Looking for coursework vs. solution files and solution video.
