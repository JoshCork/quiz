# General Notes
A detailed account of my experience in reverse chronological order.

## Day 1: 11/03/2017

- Leaving off here:

  - I started writing the solution based on GoByExample work and stumbling through things.  I am now able to read a file line by line. 

  - Need to pick up here on Monday and understand what the scan split function is doing specifically and then write the output of iterating through that into a map?  Into an array?  into a name value pair? I should probably document strategy first thing on Monday.

- Confusion: Looking for coursework vs. solution files and solution video.
